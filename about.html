    <h2>What do we trying to do?</h2>

    <p class="para">
        The result we build this website is that we want our customers having a different way to get up. Nowadays, the
        inofrmation is too much so that user need to select useful information from what they have been reading which
        might lead to wasting a lot of time. With our webstie, it is easy for user to have a different way to "Wake up".
        Users don't need to transfer from one app to another app, our app will contain everything they want to see when
        they wake up.

        something about us that make sus unique.
